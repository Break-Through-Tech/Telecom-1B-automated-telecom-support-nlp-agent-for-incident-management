## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use customer tweets and Classification + Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build an AI agent to resolve or to escalate customer issues. This will help out company address customer satisfaction and provide quick turn around times for customer service problems.

### Success Criteria
The model accuracy of classification of customer tweets and whether or not the agent  is outputting useful insights on customer problems. 

- Model Accuracy <= 70%
- Nice looking agent AI outputs

### Stretch Goal
Adding more functionality to agent AI and creating different dashboards to the agent output.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| September | Data Cleaning & Labeling | EDA + cleaning dataset to isolate just telecom messages and important phrases <br>- Drop General/Other label from data due to noise <br>- Address class imbalanced labels (ex.use weights)<br>-Remove @mentions <br>-Remove URLs https://t.co/... links <br>-Decode HTML entities like &amp;amp; to & and &lt;lt to < using html.unescape() <br>-Normalize text with lowercase, remove punctuation, special characters |
| October | Vectorization & Baseline Modeling | Vectorize words to matrix + Baseline model training + Experimentation + Evaluation <br> - F1 score, Accuracy, Precision, Confusion Matrix |
| November | AI Agent Development | Creation of AI Agent of using model to output a action (creating issue ticket) |
